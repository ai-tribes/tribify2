# Tribify.ai Development Worklist

## High Priority

### Transaction Batching
- [ ] Implement batching for multiple transactions (tried this,got stuck)
- [ ] Reduce number of required signatures
- [ ] Optimize for gas efficiency

> This is critical and should be tackled first. We can use TransactionBuilder to combine multiple instructions into a single transaction. Key challenges:
> - Need to handle failed transactions gracefully
> - Must respect Solana's transaction size limits
> - Should implement retry logic for failed batches
> - Consider using versioned transactions for better throughput

### Swap Integration
- [ ] Fix Pump.fun transaction signing
- [ ] Complete conversion modals
- [ ] Test with small amounts first

> The Pump.fun integration is proving tricky. Suggestions:
> - Consider Jupiter as a backup DEX - it's more documented
> - Need to analyze successful Pump.fun transactions on-chain
> - Should implement slippage protection
> - Current issue seems to be with instruction format

### Messaging System
- [ ] Troubleshoot Pusher integration
- [ ] Implement server-side messaging
- [ ] Add real-time updates

> Pusher might be overkill. Consider:
> - Server-Sent Events (SSE) for simpler one-way updates
> - WebSocket direct connection
> - Or even polling with exponential backoff for MVP

## Medium Priority

### Documentation
- [ ] Complete docs page
- [ ] Add API documentation
- [ ] Include usage examples

> Documentation is crucial but can be built incrementally:
> - Start with basic usage guides
> - Add video tutorials
> - Document common errors and solutions

### Trading Configuration
- [ ] Build BuyConfigModal Component
  - [ ] Implement UI from screenshot
    - [ ] Wallet & Amount settings section
    - [ ] Transaction settings section
    - [ ] Time settings section
    - [ ] Budget section
  - [ ] Add state management
  - [ ] Connect Randomize/Save/Start buttons
  - [ ] Add validation logic
  - [ ] Implement transaction sequence

- [ ] Build SellConfigModal Component
  - [ ] Mirror BuyConfigModal structure
  - [ ] Adapt settings for sell operations
  - [ ] Add sell-specific validations
  - [ ] Implement sell sequence

> New modals development plan:
> - Create as separate components from ConversionModal
> - Use same styling system for consistency
> - Implement proper state management
> - Add comprehensive input validation
> - Build transaction execution system
> - Include progress tracking

### Wallet Management
- [ ] Improve wallet tracking in modals
- [ ] Test external funding wallet integration
- [ ] Investigate multiple Phantom wallet connections

> Multiple wallet connections is tricky. Options:
> - Could use different adapters (Phantom + Solflare)
> - Or implement wallet switching
> - Need to maintain clear state management
> - Consider using wallet-adapter-react hooks

## Future Features

### Token Sniping
- [ ] Add general CA functions
- [ ] Enable sniping for any token
- [ ] Implement conversion to Tribify

> This could be a killer feature but needs careful implementation:
> - Need robust token validation
> - Must protect users from scam tokens
> - Consider implementing token analysis tools
> - Add liquidity checking

### Voting System
- [ ] Verify Cursor's implementation
- [ ] Design voting mechanism
- [ ] Implement if needed

> Lower priority. If implemented:
> - Use on-chain voting for transparency
> - Consider token-weighted voting
> - Need anti-manipulation measures

## Technical Debt

### Performance
- [ ] Investigate RPC rate limiting with Helius
- [ ] Research JITO integration
- [ ] Test random distributions

> RPC issues are critical:
> - Consider RPC endpoint fallbacks
> - Implement caching where possible
> - JITO could help with MEV protection
> - Need to understand Helius pricing tiers

### Security
- [ ] Audit wallet connections
- [ ] Verify transaction security
- [ ] Test external wallet funding

> Security is paramount:
> - Need thorough transaction simulation
> - Implement spending limits
> - Add warning systems for suspicious actions
> - Consider professional audit

## Questions to Resolve
1. How to handle multiple Phantom wallet connections?
2. What is the optimal batching strategy for transactions?
3. How to implement time-based Caldera features?
4. What is JITO and how can we integrate it?
5. How to optimize RPC calls with Helius rate limits?

> Key questions to address:
> - Multiple connections might need wallet-adapter modifications
> - Batching strategy depends on instruction types
> - Caldera features need careful timing mechanisms
> - JITO helps with MEV but needs integration work
> - Helius optimization might need request bundling

# Tribify Staking Implementation Worklist

## 1. Write and Test Solana Program
- Set up Anchor development environment
- Complete the staking program implementation:
  - Initialize stake function
  - Unstake function
  - APY calculation logic
  - Token vault management
  - PDA (Program Derived Address) handling
- Write comprehensive tests:
  - Test staking with different durations
  - Test unstaking after lock period
  - Test early unstaking prevention
  - Test reward calculations
  - Test edge cases and error conditions

## 2. Deploy Program to Devnet
- Build the program for deployment
- Create deployment keypair
- Fund deployment wallet
- Deploy to devnet first for testing:
  ```bash
  solana config set --url devnet
  anchor deploy
  ```
- Save the deployed program ID
- Initialize the stake vault PDA
- Test basic interactions on devnet

## 3. Update Frontend Code
- Add the deployed program ID to environment variables
- Implement the full staking transaction:
  - Create stake account PDA
  - Handle token approvals
  - Build and send staking transaction
  - Handle transaction confirmation
- Implement unstaking:
  - Check lock duration
  - Build and send unstaking transaction
  - Handle rewards distribution
- Add loading states and error handling
- Update UI to show staking status

## 4. Test Full Flow
- Test complete flow on devnet:
  - Wallet connection
  - Token approval
  - Staking transaction
  - Lock period enforcement
  - Unstaking transaction
  - Reward distribution
- Test error cases:
  - Insufficient balance
  - Early unstaking attempts
  - Invalid transactions
- Fix any issues found during testing

## 5. Deploy to Mainnet
- Review and audit code
- Deploy program to mainnet:
  ```bash
  solana config set --url mainnet-beta
  anchor deploy
  ```
- Update frontend with mainnet program ID
- Final testing on mainnet
- Monitor initial transactions

## Notes
- Current program ID placeholder: "YOUR_PROGRAM_ID_ONCE_DEPLOYED"
- Need to implement calculate_rewards function in Rust program
- Consider adding emergency unstake function for critical issues
- Add proper logging and monitoring
- Consider adding program upgrade authority
