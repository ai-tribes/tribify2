- [x] Move context providers to proper files
  - [x] Created AuthContext with wallet connection functionality
  - [x] Enhanced TribifyContext
  - [x] Maintained GovernanceContext
- [ ] Create a proper authentication flow
- [x] Add additional common components (Button, Modal, etc.)
- [x] Complete the Router implementation with all necessary routes

### Week 3: Feature Migration (Part 1) (In Progress)

- [x] Begin Wallet Feature Migration
  - [x] Create basic WalletPage component in feature folder
  - [x] Create WalletService for wallet operations
  - [x] Update Router to use new WalletPage component
  - [ ] Complete WalletPage implementation
  - [ ] Migrate FundSubwallets component
  - [ ] Migrate TokenDistributor component
  - [ ] Create wallet-specific hooks and utilities

- [ ] Migrate Sniper Feature
  - [ ] Create SnipePage component in feature folder

  - [ ] Extract sniper-specific utilities

### Week 4: Feature Migration (Part 2) (Planned)

- [ ] Migrate Governance Feature

- [ ] Migrate Identity Verification Feature
- [ ] Verify Application Functionality

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Begin refactoring App.js by extracting key functionality into services
2. ✅ Move all context-related code to dedicated files
3. ✅ Create additional common components needed across features
4. ✅ Begin migrating the first feature (Wallet) to its new location
5. Complete the Wallet feature migration by implementing all functionality
6. Continue with Sniper feature migration
7. Implement additional wallet-related sub-components:
   - WalletList
   - WalletStats
   - WalletGenerateForm
   - WalletActions

## Technical Debt to Address

- Large component files need to be broken down further
- Inconsistent style handling needs standardization
- Error handling needs improvement
- Missing proper form validation
- Limited test coverage
- Dependency management (consider using package versions)
- Security improvements for wallet seed storage
